# What is this?

Users of **Spotify** are left out of a simple but essential piece of functionality: ***As a Spotify User, I want to know when an artist I follow releases something new.*** Spotify has what is known as the **Release Radar,** which is a curated playlist containing new music of your followed artists. There are three main issues with this, though:
1. The Release Radar is only updated weekly, meaning users potentially receive updates up to a week after a release
2. Users are only presented this information in the form of songs in a playlist, not decribing the type of release (album, single, etc.)
3. A user never knows which artists are releasing at what time. If you never check your Release Radar, you likely miss a release, especially if you follow artists in an underground scene

**Botify** attempts to remedy this. **Botify will connect to Spotify, keep track of the artists you follow, and send you a personal message whenever they upload something new.**


## Wow! Amazing! But I don't use Spotify...
Do you think Botify cares? ***You can use Botify even if you don't have a Spotify account.***


## Sounds cool! How do the notifications work?
Right now we send all our notifications through private messages in [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). This is for a few reasons:
1. Many people already have Discord and are used to getting notifications when something relevant to them pops up
2. This Discord bot can be expanded to provide notifications for other things. Discord bots are incredibly easy to set up
3. You can control your notifications through Discord without having to even link a Spotify account (if you don't have Spotify)


## Do I really need more notifications in my life?
We at Botify know how frustrating it is to receive endless notifications that aren't relevant to you. That's why **we allow you control over what notifications you receive.** When you connect to our app through Spotify, you are opted-in to receive album and single release notifications on the artists you follow. If you don't want to follow certain artists, It's easy to opt-out of individual artists through our web client, or even through our Discord interface.


## I want to use this right now!
Well you can! Botify is currently in a beta testing phase, and you can [try it out for free](https://botify.michaelrotuno.dev).

## I have an idea to make this better
We're always open to suggestions. Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/868xdrY) has a channel for this, which is the preferred method of communicating. You can also email `michaelprotuno@gmail.com` if you wish to.
